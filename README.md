Hi there! My name is Sanskar Singh and I am currently a college student studying Bachelor of Technology at LNCT, Bhopal, India.

I have always had a passion for programming and technology, and I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to further explore and develop my skills through various coursework and personal projects. Some of my notable projects on GitHub include my personal portfolio website, TicTacToe game and Snake game.

I am proficient in languages such as CPP and Python and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and learn new technologies.

In addition to my studies, I am also actively involved in Google Developer Student Club - LNCT and Google Developers group - Bhopal. Outside of my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I enjoy listening to music and binge watching movies :movie_camera:

I am excited to continue my journey as a developer and to contribute to the open source community through my work on GitHub. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out! :smile:
